let totalNumberOfStorageInMb = 8000

let oneGigabyte = 1000

let thePhonesCurrentUsedSpace = 3000

let oneMinuteOfVideo = 150

let amountOfMinutesOfAVideoToFillThePhone = totalNumberOfStorageInMb * totalNumberOfStorageInMb - thePhonesCurrentUsedSpace

let answerIs = amountOfMinutesOfAVideoToFillThePhone / oneMinuteOfVideo
