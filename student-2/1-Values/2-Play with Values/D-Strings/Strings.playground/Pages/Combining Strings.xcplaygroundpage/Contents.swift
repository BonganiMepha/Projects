/*:
## Combining Strings
Programmers often need to put several strings together.

For example, you might see a message like _Chris likes your post_ in a social media app.

In Swift, you can combine strings by adding them together, also known as *concatenation*.
 */
// This might change over time
let username = "Chris"

// This part of the message will get reused
let likesYourPostMessage = "likes your post"

// Concatenate strings by using the plus sign
let finishedMessage = username + " " + likesYourPostMessage


  let firstName = "Bongani"

  let likesReading = " Knows 200 truths about love "

  let finishedmessage = firstName + " " + likesReading
 print(finishedmessage)

// Declare a lastName constant

// Combine the strings into a fullName constant

// Combine your full name with likesYourPostMessage
