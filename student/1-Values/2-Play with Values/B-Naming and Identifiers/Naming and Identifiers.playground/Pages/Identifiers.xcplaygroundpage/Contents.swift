/*:
 - Experiment: There are even more changes in the number of pets expected at the pet show.\
To add new kinds of animals, add new lines of code that define new constants. (To add a new line of code, just click in a blank line in the area above and start typing.)

Make the following additions:
- Someone is bringing a pot-bellied pig (a mammal).
- Someone is bringing a fish (not a mammal).
- Someone is bringing a snake (definitely not a mammal).

Next, learn about choosing names.
